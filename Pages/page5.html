       “The Constants <br>
        The basic structure of the game consists of three components:<br>
        1)There is a role of pattern-maker, and a role of pattern-follower.<br>
        2) All rules should be about selection of pieces and their formal relations.<br>
        3)Rules must be made ‘in silence’.”<br>

        “All control is subject to constraints. Different kinds of constraints define different kinds of control.”

        This week's reading got me thinking about the control a designer has. 
        The way the constants are decided, may restrict a "pattern follower". Also the concept of 
        rules made in silence is interesting. I believe this is also an act of controlling. It could also be seen 
        as a form of manipulation is a more dense context. 
        <br>
        How can designers practice this power of creating rules in silence 
        for a positive impact? What happens to the results, when they dont follow the rules? Are those results 
        useless or perhaps offer something even more interesting?
