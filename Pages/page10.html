        "And this is not because of some mysterious superiority that is sometimes assigned to the 
        printed word:the source code is still readable because it was recorded on absolutely worthless material.
        There is not much one can do with cheap paper that is printed on both sides"<br><br>
        "The social component of preservation that I am referring to is not really
        about convincing the right people that something is in fact worth being preserved, 
        but rather about allowing a piece of culture to be taken care of by culture itself.
        The more people who have a chance to lay their eyes on "The Source" the more likely
        it is that the software will survive in one form or another." (last page)

        The last quote from the reading particularily stood out to me. It is noteworthy that 
        source code is considered part of culture. I definately agree with that, as source code has 
        become part of our visual culture. It represents what people focused and spend their lives doing. 
        It is telling of a careers that people adopted and what they spend hours studying and writing.

        Will Code become the norm in the coming years? Perhaps a compulsary language that 
        you will have to study in school? Will code be preserved late in a someplace like a 
        museum? Have the code that were written for the very forst time 
        been preserved?
