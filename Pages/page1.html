<p>DANMICISM by BOB COBBING <br><br> Cobbing was a British poet of the 20th century.
     Above are examples of some of his visual poetry."Cobbing's entry into the world 
     of concrete poetry came in 1964, with the writing of his alphabetical sequence
      ABC In Sound. Although he claimed the texts derived from auditory hallucinations 
      during a bout of 'flu, its use of puns, foreign languages, palindromes and 
      technical jargon suggests elaborate craftsmanship.As his texts became progressively 
      freer, any mark - whether letter-shape,
       lip imprint, or inkblot - was readable as a sign on the page. Shape and
       texture suggested vocalisation and sound to Cobbing and the performers 
       he increasingly worked with during the 1970s, such as musicians Paul 
       Burwell and David Toop, and poets Paula Claire and Bill Griffiths.
       Moaning, sighing, shouting, even sneezing, became as common as words or phonetics."</p>

        recently, I've been interested in visual poetry and have been 
        doing research about artists who practice it and the different
        ways of visualising words, sounds etc. I have always been a visual person, and 
        often find myself short of words to describe things/ feelings. For this class, 
        I am interested in incorporate some of these concepts, ways of visualising I have been 
        reading about.
