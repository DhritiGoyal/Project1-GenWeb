         "An app which tracked the timestamp of their work and the number of mouse clicks and key presses
        they performed wile working on the platform during 24 hours. She used the collected data
        to produce two line drawings and two animations portraying the 
         work of this on-demand online workforce in the form of infographics"(page 43)<br><br>
        "When a vision is not achieved collectively it represents not much more than a personal 
        endeavour to build one's own pyramid"(page 56)<br><br>
        "It is hyperemployement-with its endless flow of notifications, alarms, tasks that 
        need to be completed, things that need to be seen, activities that need to be 
        quantified to feed the platforms hunger for data-that fills the gaps between the chunks of 
         our late-capitalist fragmented jobs"(page 57)<br><br>
        "Praise of Laziness: Laziness is the absence of movement and thought, just dumb time-
        total amnesia. It is also indifference, staring at nothing, non-activity, impotence.
        It is sheer stupidity, a time of pain, futile concentration. Those virtues of laziness are 
        important factors in art. Knowingabout laziness is not enough, it must be practiced and perfected."

        Personally, I find coding extremely tough and confusing! However, I am intuiged by the resluts 
        one is able to produce using code and using activities and actions that taken to produce something is 
        an interesting way to look at things. I was also thinking about a web page that is generative based on the 
        number of clicks and key presses people made, once landing on it. <br>
        Then thinking about laziness as a factor of art is an interesting take. I am interested in 
        how laziness changes the shape of time for a person. Does non-activity slow and morph time or does it 
        spped it up? This also reminded me of the clock we made using JavaScript. I wonder how I can 
        come up with ways of representing time as an completely abstract concept. Does it go away in the future?
        Is the Infinte loop mandatory?
