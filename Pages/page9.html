        "Computers are enormously powerful information-processing machines; they are also, 
        culturally speeaking, toys. When we play with them we follow freely the absolutely binding
        logical rules of infomation processing, which epitomises play activity"(page 236)<br><br>
        "This looseness spreads throughout three, more focused manifestations of play
        that define our age: profusion, complexity, and emergence. Each of these terms 
        mines a progressively deeper and richer vein of intellectual and cultural play that issues
        from the computer's micro-informational power and determinism"(page 236)<br><br>
        "It appears not as fixed structure, timeless and true, but rather as ongoing, playful activity, 
        time-and place-bound, teaming with local rather than universal truths"(page 237)

        The language in this reading was very specific. The term "play" is interesting 
        as it is often associated with childishness and frivolity. However to compare a cmoputer 
        to a toy, creates a completely new meaning and purpose for the machine.
        Furthermore, it is interesting to thing of certain playful activities and removing them from 
        their obligatory "place and time". For instnace, what if toys were placed in a court room? 
        People have formed certain ways of living, that have become the norm now, anything outside
        that is considered useless, and to put it in simpler words unnecessary and stupid. However, 
        looking at it from a design perspective could produce some interesting results.
