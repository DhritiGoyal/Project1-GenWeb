        "Duchamp gave sculpture over to information on two registers: He desublimated matter by 
        suspending it between two names, shovel and shovel abd sculpture; and he abandoned 
        objects for discourse. Desublimation and abandonment"(page 3)<br><br>
        "Duchamp used the category of art to liberate materiality from commodifiable form;
        the NFT deploys the category of art to extract private property from 
        freely available information."(page 4)<br><br>
        "The relation between matter and property is political. Art can function as a 
        technology of extraction, or it can, as Duchamp's work did, destabilize the movement of matter's 
        becoming-property in ways that are historically specific and aesthetically engrosing." (page 4)<br><br>
        "The NFT is a social contract that values property over material experience.
        That contract can be broken."(page 4)

        The fact that this social contract of NFTs is definately daunting for the poeople 
        who create NFTs. Does it take away from the value of the work? Should there be more ways 
        we should be thinking off, to create a community for artists and designers? Something that is much more 
        reliable? Should everyone be allowed to make NFTs, or should there be a selectional process that creates 
        a level for the quality of work? Offcourse, this could create a lot many problems than solve the past ones. 
        Such as who decides how good a piece of work is? Since this question is so subjective, it could lead to an 
    endless debate. It also takes away from creating a free platform, for anyone to upload their work.
