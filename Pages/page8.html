        “Codes typically serve three main purposes. They are used for communication, clarification, or obfuscation.”(page 11) <br><br>
        “This type of code–often called an algorithm, procedure, or program–defines a specific process with enough detail to allow
         the instructions to be followed. <br>
        1)There are many ways to write an algorithm.<br>
        2)An algorithm requires assumptions.<br>
        3)An algorithm includes decisions.<br>
        4)A complex algorithm should be broken down into modular pieces.”<br><br>
        “Software is a tool for the mind. While the industrial revolution produced
        tools to augment the body, such as the steam engine and the automobile, 
        the information revolution is producing tools to extend the intellect.” <br><br>

        “The influence of code is not limited to the screen and projected image.
        It is also felt in physical space. Code is used to control elements of 
        products, architecture, and installations. It is used to create files 
        that are outputs as prints and made physical through computer-controlled
        machines that cut and assemble materials, including wood, metal, and plastic.”

        I always find the word "algorithm" confusing. After the reading, I beileve that algorithm 
        can be equated to building a system. I wonder what are some more examples of 
        the tools that extend the intellect. At its core, I believe that even the phone 
        could be considered an example of the above. It is almost an extension of the human mind.

        I am interested in understanding how code could control architecture and physical space. 
        An example from one of the previous clases comes to mind (above urban development) when talking about physical 
        space. Furthermore, using code to build materials is extremly clever and effective. I wonder i, we as desgners 
        can use these controlled outputs and create something that is much more loose and fluid in its form(letting go off that control)
