    <div class="quotesFROMreading">
        "With automation, it is not only jobs that disappear, and complex roles that reappear.
        Centuries of specialist stress in pedagogy and in the arrangement of data now with the 
        instantaneous retrieval of information made possible by electricty."(page 346)<br><br>
        "This is a familiar pattern in electric technology in general. It ends
        the old dicotomies between culture and technology, between art and commerce, 
        and between work and leisure"(pg 347)<br><br>
        "The tendency is to speak of electricity as painters speak of space; namely,
        that it is a variable condition that involves the special positions
        of two or more bodies"(pg 347)<br><br>
        "Instant synchronization of numerous operations has ended the old mechanical
        pattern of setting up operations in lineal sequence."(pg 349)<br><br>
        "Automation affects not just production, but every phase of consumption and marketing;
        for the consumer becomes producer in the automation circuit, quite as much as the 
        reader of the mosaic telegraph press makes his own news, or just is his own news"(page 349)

        <br>
        It is interesing to understand how so many of our activities, that are now considered 
        "day-to-day", were made possibel due to the invention of some core things. This include 
        electricity. I believe, if we look at electricity in this way, it can be considered a 
        part of our visual culture. It explains a lot of our jobs, activities and why we are able to 
        conduct certain things. It is also a huge factor why globalization was possible, enabling 
    international connections, which led to a whole set of new interactions between people and cultures.
