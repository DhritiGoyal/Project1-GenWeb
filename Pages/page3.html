    <div class="quotesFROMreading">“Shunned by the art world during its formative years, net art never quite 
        fit into the master narratives of art, or technology for that matter. Jodi’s infrastructural 
        modernism, if we can call it that, is interesting because it suspends the distinction between 
        art and technology without making one subservient to the other.” <br>
        “Jodi are artists who insist on the importance of seemingly uninteresting technical minutiae, 
        such as character-encoding schemes and other tedious matters.”

        From the exercises we performed in class, I feel like we focused a lot on the 
        "uninteresting technical minutiae", for instance using buttons and tags to create compositions.
        I found it interesting to focus on these simpler things, as it serves as a comment on web 1.0 and where
        it all began. Today we also have more technology that make it easier to create more complex structures.

        Does the value of generative art change over time? 
        Why is crowdsourcing important as compared to the years of
        experience the artists themselves have? What is the origin of generative art?
