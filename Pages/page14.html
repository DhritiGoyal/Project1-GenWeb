        "You would have to be unbelievably ethnocentric not to see that technological progress is 
        far from being universal, and that the south of the planet, the so called
        "developing world", does not enjoy the same reality as Silicon Valley as far as technological goods are 
        concerned, even though both are part of an ever-narrowing world." (pg 65) <br>
        <br>
        "Subsequently, modern painting would focus its issues on what it contains in terms
        of scaling things down to mechanical recording latter, and gesture, which would give rise
        to abstract art" (pg67)
       <br><br>
       "the digital image, for its part, results not from the movement of a body, 
       but from a calculation"(pg 69)
       <br><br>
       "The influence of technogy on the art that is its contemporary is wielded 
       within limits circumscribed by this latter between the real and the imaginary"(page 71)

        The digital image is created from a calulation, however, to create the digital image 
        from the movement of the body could be interesing. Images created from motion of the object in front of 
        the screens come to mind when talking about this. Once, I get a grip on how to use p5.js, 
        I want to try out some other JS libraries that make use of the video camera, and sounds that 
        are based on the environment of the user. I feel like these elements enable sites to produce outputs 
        that are personal and customizable. <br>
        My final project in this class was an interesting example of the influence of technology on art. 
        I feel like I have always shyied away from amalgamating these two things, primarily because I thought, 
        I dont want my art to loose authenticit and its raw form. However, code really helped me to 
        push through and create a system that produces thousands of unique results. I believe that the quantity 
        of the outputs is also an interesting factor to be considered in this techno world.

                  <!-- Reading Response: How has Software affected the Visual Arts<br><br>
            "art that is transactional in that they deal with underlying structures
            of communication and energy exchange"(pg 21)
            "Software is a tool for the mind. While the industrial revolution
            produced tools to augment the body, such as the steam engine and
            the automobile, the information revolution is producing tools to extend the 
            intellect."(pg 17) -->
