        When a person hurts you badly,<br>
        line up 100 panes of glass in <br>
        The field and shoot a bullet<br>
        Through it.<br>
        Take a copy of a map made by the cracks<br>
        On each glass and <br>
        Send a map a day for 100 days <br>
        To the person who has hurt you. <br>

            and record/ document the result and compile them in a book.<br>
