    “The wall drawings’ very nature is collaborative and participatory.
     They are called to life only in order to be seen, and only when 
     someone beyond the artist expresses a desire to see them”<br><br>

    “I have written elsewhere about the larger historical shifts 
    in modern design as it has moved from its roots in the aesthetic 
    logic of formalism in the first half of the twentieth century with
    its basic in the object to the symbolic logic of a designed objects 
    meaning in society and culture at large in the second half”<br><br>
    
    “One of the main advantages of the urban development based on
     conditional design was that it could be kept in continuous movement.
      The city should be seen not as a design but as a process in which
       time, mutual relations and change were the primary factors. If you 
     wanted to change your home, there was no need to submit a formal 
       request for a permit. All you have to do was to consult the conditions
        that applied to your neighborhood.”

    We followed the instructions and drew everyones patterns. We were the code. Creating these output. Interesting juxtaposition to us using machines to code for this entire semester and now becoming the code ourselves. 
   Some turned out super interesting, but some were pretty confusing. I saw everyone just peeking over the person next to them to see how they are taking in the information. Vague language can be interpreted so differently
    by people-can create super interesting results.<br>  <br>
   How important is language will giving out instructions. How can vague language 
   be used in favour of a project? Are there only certain scenarios, where vague language 
   could work to create a system? For instance, an urban development system built on vague language could be 
   a complete disaster.
