        “The internet didn’t kill counterculture–you just wont find it on Instagram” <br><br>
        “The man, of course, who, with his white collar, white skin, and short hair,
        singlehandedly symbolizes dominant cultural norms. In the age of social media, personal 
        expression has become the most valuable form of currency, yet we still use the term 
        ‘counterculture’ to describe alternatives to the hegemonic forces of yesteryear.”<br><br>

        “(Zuckerberg, Bezoz, Thiel)Their empires were built according to the ‘peaceful mechanisms’
        of free market capitalism-and that society has adopted their tools and spaces through its 
        own free will. If pressed, they’ll point out how their platforms reflect the countercultural 
        demands of earlier generations: eschewing big government and vertical corporate while encouraging
        personal fulfillment and flat organizational structures.”

        Generative art is about a lot of the variables that are subject to change: 
        what will you decide to change is what will make the outputs interesting. 
        These interesting instructions and specific language should also be 
        easy to comprehend and not too wordy, in order to be effective. Because sadly 
        people dont read.

        What is the value of NFTs, are they just for the rich, because you
        need a certain income to be part of that? Deinstutionalising but is it
        happening in its true form? Are NFTs a part of a larger empire someone is trying to build, with a facade 
        of a "peaceful mechanism"?
