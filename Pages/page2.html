        I evoke the term ‘handmade web’ to refer to web pages coded by hand rather
        than by software; web pages made and maintained by individuals
         rather than by businesses or corporations; web pages which are 
         provisional, temporary, or one-of-a- kind; web pages which 
         challenge conventions of reading, writing, design, ownership,
          privacy, security, or identity.”(page 1) <br>
  
          I evoke the term ‘handmade web’ in order to draw attention both
           to the manual labour involved in the composition of web pages, 
           and the functioning of the web page itself as a ‘manual’, a 
           ‘handbook’, a set of instructions required for a computer 
           program to run. (page 3)

        Thinking about the use of css, since ppl around the world are viewing the content.
        Content where css isn’t available.
        What if it stops working?<br> 
         “Control is a limitation of the printed page”<br> 
         Letting go control-the key idea of this class <br> 
         Designing to fail-for its worst condition <br> 
         Free flowing web pages-key idea <br> 
         Basic is good.
         <br> 
         Is one big idea enough for the web page?
         How do you create a system for the website that feels natural for the user? Do you want it to feel natural to the user?
         How can you randomize a system? Why is there so much emphasis on the system?
